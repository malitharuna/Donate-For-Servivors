                    <p>Twelve-year-old Alamin's house rested on the bank of the Ilsha river in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family's farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka.

                    Now Alamin - whose father died of cancer a couple years back - works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin's two younger siblings, now 3 and 5.</p>

                    <h1>Women in rural Bangladesh pay more for rising cost of climate disasters</h1>
                    <p>Rural families in Bangladesh are using a large chunk of their budgets to protect themselves from climate change, especially households headed by women who are allocating up to 30 per cent of their spending for that purpose, researchers said on Wednesday.

                    The high share of spending by female-led households - many based in the flood-prone north - is double the average of 15 per cent because women have lower incomes than men.   
                    Often men from Banglades's northwest regions migrate on a seasonal basis to work elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Fresh evacuation orders were issued for tens of thousands of Sydney residents on Monday after relentless rains flooded several suburbs in Australia's largest city, with officials warning of more wild weather to come.

                    An intense low-pressure system off Australia's east coast is forecast to bring more heavy rain through Monday across New South Wales after several places in the state were hit with about a month's rain over the weekend.
                        
                    With about 30,000 residents in New South Wales state facing evacuation..</p>
