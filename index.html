                <h2>Food for a Family</h2>
                <p>No one knows when the next earthquake, flood or tsunami will strike. But we do know the scale of crisis in the world has increased exponentially in recent years. In 2018 alone, 62 million people were affected by extreme weather events and since 2017, 31 million people have been displaced as a direct result of natural disaster or conflict, with children always among the most vulnerable. </p>

                <h2>Shelter for Family</h2>
                <p>Common measures taken by rural families to adapt to climate change and reduce risks include raising the plinth of their houses above flood-water levels, planting trees and making shelters to keep livestock safe. Low-lying Bangladesh is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures, including more severe monsoon flooding, fiercer storms and higher sea levels. </p>

                <h2>Education for a Child</h2>
                <p>For the first time in human history, an entire generation of children globally have had their education disrupted. Even before the pandemic struck, millions of children were not going to school and not learning. With your help, we can educate girls who may not otherwise have the chance to learn-changing the course of their lives, their children's lives and the future of their communities.</p>
